### Built With
This project is built using Unity [2019.4.35f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

### How to use
By running the project, Unity renderer would be used by default, but by pressing the `SPACE` button, the same scene would get rendered using the ray-tracing path.
This allows easy comparison.

### Features
* Hard shadows
* Reflections with customizable number of bounces
* Specular lighting model
* Sphere and mesh tracing
* Point lights
* Integrated in the existing Unity workflow, which allows switching between default Unity renderer and ray tracing path
* Accumulative anti aliasing implementation
* Skybox rendering
* Fake ambient occlusion
